- Gatsby party
	- Sets the tone of the book to see how extravagent he is
	- Nick is simulatiously thrileld and bewildred by the scenceA
	- He runs into Jordan
	- unsure what to think, gets drunk, ends up talking to gatsby
	- Same division in WW1
		- Division is big group, not neccesarily side by side
	- Point of connection for them
## Gatsby
---
- Makes you feel like the center of attention, YOU AREmost important person in the room
- Like [[Daisy & Myrtle Analysis|daisy]], but he uses his smile
### Jordan's Reaction to Gatsby
- Oxford man but she doesnt thik he went there
- She doesn't think he went to oxford based off of the way he speaks
- Something about him strikes her as odd

## Owl Eyes
---
- Astonished by the fact that the books are real
- He thought [[Gatsby]] was a Poser
- The realness of the books didn't change his mind about Gatsby
- Still thinks [[Gatsby]] is some sort of froud, but an elaborate froud
- Some people would have fake libraries in thier hourse
	- Not the case with Gatsby
- Wow! He's going so far to fool use.
