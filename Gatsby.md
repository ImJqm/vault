Just read Chatper 3. Gatsby is interesting. Both Jordan and the Owl Eyes man seem to think he is a fraud.

Owl Eyes is astouned by how "real" Gatsby's facade is. He went all this way to make all the books real.

Jordan, on the other hand, says that despite the fact Gatsby claims to be from Oxford, he doesn't talk like it.

Gatsby is a man who carefully chooses his words. He is kind, and always makes you feel like the most important person in the room. Yet, he stands there, at the top of the venue, watching people enjoy *his* party, alone. 

Gatsby doesn't want anyone to be mad at him. Someone broke their dress at his party, and he bought htem a new one.
