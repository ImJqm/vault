### Nick
---

Nick doesn't necessarily leave the interaction in the apartment because he is scared or physically intimidated by Tom. He has known Tom longer than anyone else there, and he is the most capable of talking some sense into him after Tom slaps Daisy, but he doesn't. This isn't necessarily because the class dispute, or because Nick doesn't like the high-society life of the Elite, he isn't quite there yet throughout the book.

The explicit reason is never stated, we can only insinuate. It could be because its a domestic affair, "its not my issue", why should I deal with it? This I think become definitely apparent here:

"I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about
him than I was about that man there.’
She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at
me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I had
played no part in her past."

Here, Myrtle is saying that she was Never actually "crazy" about her husband, Mr. Wilson. And, although she might be saying it to appeal to Tom, the bigger impact is Nick's reaction. He doesn't want to be apart of this. And when Tom and Myrtle get into a conflict, he leaves because its not his issue. He may also just feel or uncomfortable. Or he has come to the realization that the state of this Relationship is beyond saving.

### Myrtle
---

Myrtle is definitively with Tom for his money. This is made apparent by her continuous shopping of items. "I need to make a list". She mentions that a lot. And she definitely makes an effort to really "live" the high society life, putting on her "costume" of a dress and flaunting it. She also talks to the servants as if they are nothing, even though she doesn't come from money herself.

### Daisy
---

Daisy is interesting. She has a very pessimistic outlook on life. She clearly doesn't morally agree with Tom, and clearly is aware of his affair with Myrtle. Yet, she stays with him anyway. Why does she leave? She comes from wealth. But it might be some sort of social taboo. We need more information.
