This is a current list of plugins 

## Notebook Navigator
--- 
I think this is one of the most useful obsidian plugins. It adds the notebook view on the left. This is what I saw in sylvan Franklin's interview with Ewan.

## TODO:
--- 
- Add Properites for data created and date updated [[https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=Update%20frontmatter%20modified%20date]]
- Sort tags by color in graph
- Some sort of todo manager with a calender view
- Cosine Similairty integration
- Better Theming
