### Personal Writing Proposal


What if I told you there was a material with such low density, that it was composed of 99.8% air. And what if I told you that this material was one of the most thermally robust substances, with 6 inches of it providing roughly the same amount of insulation as 10 feet of fiberglass? And what if I were to tell you that this material is real, and is currently growing hastily into the consumer market as we speak? The material in question?: Aerogel.

Aerogel was invented in 1931 by American chemical engineer Samuel Stephens Kristler on a bet from his colleague that he couldn't remove liquid from Gelatin. Gelatin is composed of ~90% liquid, and ~10% solid. Kristler won the bet using a process known as supercritical drying, a process in which a solvent(in this case $CO_{2}$) is superheated to a phase of matter where it is both solid and liquid. In this phase, the liquid inside of the gelatin was able to be safely removed without harming the structural integrity of the solid component of the gelatin. What is left is Aerogel.

In 1993, using a contract from NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Aspen Systems Inc. developed a new Aerogel manufacturing process that vastly boosted the efficiency, and decreased the cost of production. Using this new production method, NASA was able to integrate aerogel into all sorts aeronautic functionalities. Soon, NASA was using it as an ultra-lightweight thermal insulator for spacecraft, Mars Rovers like Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity, and cryogenic rocket fuel tanks. NASA also used aerogel to capture high speed cosmic dust without damaging it on the 1999 Stardust Mission.

With the rise of this new manufacturing process, more and more commercial applications have become available for aerogel; from building insulation, to clothing lines, to medicine storage, and now: Water Bottles! 

The AeroBottle$^{TM}$ is a new type of never-before-seen water bottle that utilizes Aerogel as an insulator. Aerogel was a conductivity factor of $0.02\space WM^{-1}K^{-1}$, making it a near perfect insulator. Traditional Water bottles use steel or some other sort of insulator. Maybe they double layer it. Maybe they even put a vacuum inn between the layers to further prevent heat dissipation. But heat can still dissipate through the lid. Vacuums can be disrupted by damage. The AeroBottle$^{TM}$'s unique AeroGel Barrier, which even covers the bottom of the lid, ensures near 0 heat dissipation, either way. Your hot liquid has never stayed hotter, and your cold liquid has never stayed colder!

To make the AeroBottle$^{TM}$ a reality, we would need a team of Engineers and manufacturers. These would be the people who could harness the current state of Aerogel production, and streamline a manufacturing process that produces a branch of Aerogel made specifically for this genre of product. They would also help formulate a perfect design for the waterbottle, creating a thin layer of Aerogel between the interior and exterior in a way that it is structurally immune to outside damages.

To prove the effectiveness of Aerogel as an insulator, lets look at the heat dissipation over time of Aerogel relative to other insulators. We will be testing both ends of the extreme.

For this first test, we will be testing the AeroBottle$^{TM}$ with 60°C Hot Cocoa in a cold -10°C night for 8 hours, and comparing its final temperature with other insulators:
```
---[ MISSION SIMULATION INITIATING ]---
Product Analyzed: The AeroBottle, a new genre of waterbottle, insulated with space-grade aerogel
Simulation Parameters: 8 hours, from 60°C to an ambient -10°C.

---[ THERMAL EFFICIENCY RESULTS ]---

Final temperature with Your Aerogel Product: 58.76°C
Final temperature with Standard Fiberglass Insulation: 57.51°C
Final temperature with Goose Down: 57.82°C
Final temperature with Basic Wool: 56.89°C
Final temperature with Steel: -10.00°C

---[ Simulation Result ]---
Based on a 8-hour simulation, the proposed product
'The AeroBottle, a new genre of waterbottle, insulated with space-grade aerogel',
 demonstrated superior thermal efficiency.
 It maintained a significantly higher final temperature compared to standard materials,

As you can see, the AeroBottle$^{TM}$ lost the least amount of heat throughout the 8 cold hours. Now let's test the other end of the extreme. Say we have some 1°C ice cold water, that we want to keep cold on a hot 38°C day:

Final temperature with Your Aerogel Product: 1.66°C
Final temperature with Standard Fiberglass Insulation: 2.32°C
Final temperature with Goose Down: 2.15°C
Final temperature with Basic Wool: 2.64°C
Final temperature with Steel: 38.00°C

As we can see, the AeroBottle$^{TM}$ barely heated up in comparison to other insulators.

Thanks to the help of aerogel, the AeroBottle$^{TM}$ is a product that can help millions around the globe drink the drinks they love at their intended temperature.
